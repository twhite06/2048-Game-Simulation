Purpose:  

        That famed and legendary number . . . 2. 0. 4. 8. The game that took America by storm is still a favorite among many millennials today. This project is a simulation of 2048 on a terminal (ran through Linux). Using the "w" , "a", "s", and "d" keys to navigate up, left, down, and right respectively, match the numbers that are horizontally or vertically similar to increase your score. Once the board is ful with no numbers next to each other that match the game is over ! How high could you make your score ?
